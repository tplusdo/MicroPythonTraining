## MicroPython Training Basics

### What is Wokwi?
Wokwi is an online platform that allows you to simulate various microcontrollers and electronics projects. It provides a virtual environment where you can design, code, and test your circuits without needing physical hardware. Wokwi supports popular microcontrollers such as Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico, and you can interact with components like LEDs, buttons, sensors, and more.

### What is ESP32?
The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power system-on-chip (SoC) with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, designed for IoT (Internet of Things) applications, home automation, and other embedded systems. Developed by Espressif Systems.

### What is MicroPython?
MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language designed to run on microcontrollers and embedded systems. It allows you to write Python code to control hardware components, making it easier to develop firmware for small, resource-constrained devices like the ESP32, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi Pico, and other microcontrollers.
